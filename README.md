# How to run
Make sure all of the files in this repo, including your .csv file that is formatted EXACTLY like the 
example in this repo, are located in the same directory, then run the following command:
```
python3 MIG_Main.py
```

# "I use jupyter notebook and the files won't run! Your code stinks!"
Fine. Go to the terminal and change the file type like this:
1. Install p2j:
   ```
   pip install p2j
   ```
2. Run p2j:
   ```
   p2j <Your file name>
